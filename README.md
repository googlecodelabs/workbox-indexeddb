# Data driven PWA

In this codelab, you’ll use [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) and [Workbox](https://workboxjs.org/) to create a fully offline-capable, data-driven app. You'll also use [Background Sync](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync) to sync your app with the server even when your web app is closed.

## Getting started

Follow the [Google Codelabs instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/workbox-indexeddb/index.html?index=..%2F..%2Findex#0).
